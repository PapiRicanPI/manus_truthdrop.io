TruthDrop.io Site Investigation
================================
Date: December 22, 2025

Current Issues Discovered:
--------------------------

1. SERVER ERRORS (500 Internal Server Error)
   - Multiple 500 errors are showing in the console
   - The admin dashboard is showing 0 cases, 0 users, 0 admins (previously showed 21 cases, 3 users)
   - The site appears to be experiencing backend issues

2. API ENDPOINT ISSUES
   - The /api/trpc/admin.triggerNewsScan endpoint is returning HTML instead of JSON
   - This suggests the endpoint may not be properly configured or the route doesn't exist

3. AUTHENTICATION
   - User is logged in as: Papi Rican Blue (tainorican2n@gmail.com)
   - Authentication appears to be working

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Check if the tRPC router has the admin.triggerNewsScan procedure defined
2. Verify the backend code to see if this feature actually exists
3. Check the server logs for more details on the 500 errors
4. May need to implement the news scan feature if it doesn't exist yet
