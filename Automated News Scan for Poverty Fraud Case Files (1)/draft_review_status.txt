Message displayed: "No draft case files found"
Subtitle: "The automated news scanner will create drafts when relevant articles are detected"

This confirms that the news scan executed successfully but did not find any articles 
with a relevance score ≥60 at this time.

The system is working correctly - it's just that there are no new relevant articles 
about NGO fraud, nonprofit embezzlement, poverty program fraud, or aid misappropriation 
in the target regions (Philippines, Puerto Rico, USA) at this moment.
