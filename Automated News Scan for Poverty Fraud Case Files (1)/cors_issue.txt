CORS Issue Encountered
======================

The fetch request from the local server (https://8080-iwuh0o57gxopsdehq3brr-2cf659e1.manus-asia.computer) 
to truthdrop.io is being blocked due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

Error: Failed to fetch

This is because:
1. The browser is preventing cross-origin requests
2. The truthdrop.io server doesn't allow requests from our local server origin

Alternative Approach:
We need to navigate directly to truthdrop.io and execute the JavaScript there, 
where the same-origin policy will allow the request.
