Future Candy for TruthDrop.io
A living list of “nice‑to‑have” features and experiments, prioritized so today’s work stays focused while the long‑term vision is documented.

Priority 1 – Near Future (High impact, medium effort)
Dedicated /access portal page

Clear explanation of access levels (observer, researcher, custodian, admin).

Links to /apply and Ko‑fi Tier 3 expedited path, plus “support ≠ access” disclaimer.

Tighter vetting → roles mapping

Formal mapping from vetting decisions to roles (e.g., limited trial → observer, full collaborator → researcher/custodian).

Simple admin UI to adjust a user’s level with an audit trail.

Admin notes + invite workflow

Admin‑only notes field on each application.

/admin/invites page using the invite template; “Copy invite link” button.

Priority 2 – Medium Term (High impact, higher effort)
News Scan → Case linker

When a new article is ingested, auto‑suggest related cases by entities/locations/organizations.

One‑click “attach as supporting document” inside a case.

Case workspaces for writing

Per‑case “Workspace” view showing: documents, timelines, extracted quotes, and notes.

Export button that generates a clean markdown draft ready to paste into Substack.

Researcher activity dashboards

Simple metrics: active collaborators, cases touched, new documents added, redactions pending.

Helps you manage small teams and spot stalled work.

Priority 3 – Longer Term (Experiments, “candy”)
Semi‑automated Substack drafts

From a TruthDrop workspace, build a Substack‑ready draft: headline suggestions, lede options, and structured sections (Findings, Evidence, Impact).

Output as markdown for manual review before publishing.

Social distribution shortcuts

After a Substack URL is published, one panel in TruthDrop with pre‑filled posts and share buttons for X, Facebook, Bluesky, etc.

Could start by piggybacking on existing RSS → social tools.

Pattern and cluster detection across cases

Optional AI helpers that flag recurring names, shell entities, or schemes across multiple cases.

Alerts when separate files look like they belong to the same network.

Source‑side “evidence lockers”

Future vision: limited, anonymized upload portals for trusted partners to drop documents tied to a case ID, without full database access.

Keeps TruthDrop as the central vault while preserving strict access control.

Priority 4 – Nice‑to‑Have UX polish
Guided tours for new roles

Short, role‑specific onboarding overlays: “You’re an observer; here’s what you can and can’t see.”

Reduces training time for new collaborators.

Public “What’s New / Roadmap” page

Lightweight changelog plus a trimmed public version of this candy list so readers see that building is happening alongside publishing.

Recommendation: keep this file in the repo (/docs/FUTURE_CANDY_TRUTHDROP.md) and review it every few months to move items into the real roadmap or to cut them if they no longer fit.
