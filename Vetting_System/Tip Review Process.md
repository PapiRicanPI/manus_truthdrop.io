- Mark as "Under Review" to indicate investigation started
- Convert to a case file and publish
- Reject if not credible or relevant
- Contact the tipster for more information

### Workflow

The typical tip review workflow:

1. **Tip Submitted** → Status: Pending
2. **Admin Reviews** → Status: Under Review
3. **Investigation Complete** → Either:
   - Convert to published case file → Status: Published
   - Reject as not credible → Status: Rejected

### Integration with Case Files

Tips that are verified and investigated can be converted into full case files that appear in the main database. This provides a pipeline for crowdsourced fraud detection.
