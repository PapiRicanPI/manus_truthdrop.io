## 6. Current Limitations and Recommendations

While the vetting system is functional, there are some areas that could be improved:

### Current Limitations:

The admin interface is **view-only**. This means:
- You can see all application details
- You can read existing review notes
- You can view generated passwords
- **However, there are no interactive buttons to approve/reject applications directly from the interface**

### Recommendations for Enhancement:

To make the system more user-friendly, I recommend adding the following features:

1. **Approve/Reject Buttons:** Add clickable buttons next to each pending application to allow you to approve or reject with a single click.

2. **Review Notes Input Field:** Add a text field where you can type review notes before approving or rejecting an application.

3. **Email Notification System:** Automatically send an email to approved users with their login credentials.

4. **Filter and Search:** Add the ability to filter applications by status (Pending, Approved, Rejected) and search by name or email.

5. **Edit Application Form:** Provide an admin interface to customize the vetting application form fields.

**Would you like me to implement any of these enhancements?** I can add these features to make the system more interactive and easier to use.
