# TruthDrop Vetting Scorecard

Each applicant is scored 0–2 on the criteria below. Total score guides the decision:

- 0–3: Reject
- 4–6: Request more information / conditional approval
- 7–10: Approve (if no serious red flags)

## Criteria (0–2 each)

1. **Identity & Email**
   - 0 = free/disposable email, no footprint.
   - 1 = mixed signals.
   - 2 = institutional or professional email matching a verifiable person.

2. **Organization Legitimacy**
   - 0 = cannot verify organization or it looks fake.
   - 1 = unclear or very small organization.
   - 2 = clearly verifiable institution, newsroom, NGO, or academic body.

3. **Purpose & Intended Use**
   - 0 = vague, commercial, or potentially harmful.
   - 1 = partially aligned but fuzzy.
   - 2 = specific investigative/academic/public‑interest purpose.

4. **Support / Reciprocity**
   - 0 = no indication of support or attribution.
   - 1 = promises attribution but no support yet.
   - 2 = existing or pledged support via Substack, Ko‑fi, or Gumroad and explicit agreement to credit TruthDrop/The Vault.

5. **Risk / Red Flags** (reverse‑scored)
   - 2 = no red flags.
   - 1 = minor concerns.
   - 0 = clear red flags (vendetta, “various investigations,” commercial data‑mining, unethical use).

Scores and notes are recorded in the vetting panel’s review notes and/or separate secure logs.
